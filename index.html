If we define a variable, it will be defined globally.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">const number = 1;\n</code></pre>\n<p>We generally want to avoid globally scoped variables as you can very quickly run into namespacing issues.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A local scope refers to any scope defined inside the global scope. Each function defined has its own local scope.\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  src=\"https://repl.it/repls/HopefulBossyBinturong?lite=true\"\n  scrolling=\"no\"\n  frameborder=\"no\"\n  allowtransparency=\"true\"\n  allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n  sandbox=\"allow-forms\n  allow-pointer-lock\n  allow-popups\n  allow-same-origin\n  allow-scripts\n  allow-modals\"></iframe>\nLocally scoped items are not available to the global scope.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When we define a function inside a function, the inner function has access to the scope of the outer function. But not the other way around. This is Closure! Thats all it is!!</p>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  src=\"https://repl.it/repls/QuarterlyHoarseHorsechestnutleafminer?lite=true\"\n  scrolling=\"no\"\n  frameborder=\"no\"\n  allowtransparency=\"true\"\n  allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n  sandbox=\"allow-forms\n  allow-pointer-lock\n  allow-popups\n  allow-same-origin\n  allow-scripts\n  allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"anatomy-of-a-function\">Anatomy of a function</h3>\n<p>When we approach a function, one of the most valuable abilities is to comfortably understand what the goals\nand the use cases of a function are. This can be difficult when a function is not named well, however eventually\neven a poorly named function can be parsed by someone with enough experience and knowledge - for example:</p>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/CleverAptBumblebee?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\nThe naming of this function is no good - but even then, it becomes clear quickly what happens when this function is used,\nand how it is intended to be used.\n\nThere are two big things we&#39;ll focus on here, the <code>parameters</code> and the <code>return</code> of a function.\n\n#### Parameter\nThe parameters should inform you almost immediately what expected information this function needs to work. If these parameters are not \npassed in, odds are, this function is not going to behave as intended, or will most likely throw an error (you can make functions durable to prevent this, but that&#39;s neither here nor there).\n\nIn the above example, we have just one parameter, and it is named poorly. However, lets take a look at whats going on <strong>in</strong> the function.\nwe have this line\n\n<code>javascript\nreturn someParam * 10;</code>\n\nnow, we can infer something from this line. That if someParam was anything but a number, it wouldn&#39;t work as intended - thus,\nsomeParam is probably intended and expected to be a number. Let&#39;s try updating the function to be a bit clearer:\n\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/JovialOutrageousVulture?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Now this is a bit clearer. On first pass, it&#39;s clear now that the first parameter being passed in should be a number.</p>\n<h4 id=\"return\">Return</h4>\n<p>So we figured out the conceptual &#39;beginning&#39; of the function interpretation, and that is resolving the values of the parameters. This lets us know what to replace, algebraically, in the function definitions body.\nSo what&#39;s the next most important thing? Well really, what the &#39;result&#39; of this function is going to be. That&#39;s what the return keyword is used for.</p>\n<p>Before we go into it, let&#39;s talk about how the interpreter deals with functions. When a function is <strong>called</strong>, we know because of the <code>()</code> at the end.\nFor example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">myThing(5);\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can see above that myThing is being called. The interpreter, will then take that <code>5</code> we passed in, and replace the <code>aNumber</code>\nparameter with it. However, it&#39;s not done yet.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s take a new function as an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">function someNewFunction() {\n  console.log(&#39;hello world&#39;);\n}\n\nsomeNewFunction(); \\\\ console logs &#39;hello world&#39;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now that function works great, but what happens when we do this?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">let x = someNewFunction();\n`\n</code></pre>\n<p>What does <code>x</code> resolve to here? And does that console log still fire? Well the answer is that first,\nif no explicit return statement is defined for a function, at the end it, it just returns <code>undefined</code>.\nSecond, it&#39;s important to remember that when you call a function, everything inside -still- gets called,\neven if there is no return statement. So that <code>console.log</code> does fire.</p>\n<p>So let&#39;s get back to our <code>myThing</code> function. Let&#39;s take a look at what it&#39;s returning:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">return aNumber * 10;\n</code></pre>\n<p>When the interpreter gets here, it first wants to handle the operation it sees. Let&#39;s assume that what we\npassed into this function resolves aNumber as <code>5</code> - this becomes <code>5 * 10</code> which of course is <code>50</code>. So the final statement is\n<code>return 50</code>. I know this seems pedantic or overly specific, but this thought process is foundational.</p>\n<p>So, with this information, we know a bit more about what this function is doing. It&#39;s really simple, it takes a number and it returns\nthat same number times 10. Let&#39;s utilize this information to first better name the function</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">\n\\** as a side note, this is still a pure function, as a pure function is defined by a function that always\nreturns the same value no matter what, as long as the inputs are the same, and has no internal dependencies that may change,\n as well as having no hidden &#39;outputs&#39; - eg, it doesn&#39;t access an external object and mutate its value(s)\n **\\\nfunction multiplyNumberByTen(aNumber){\n  return aNumber * 10;\n}\n\nlet numberResult = multiplyNumberByTen(5);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now the first thing to note is that this is a lot more understandable. Reading just the implementation of the function\nshould give you a clear idea of the purpose. This is just a good practice, and something I&#39;ll be encouraging and noting in your own code.</p>\n<p>Additionally, because our function is returning a value, our <code>numberResult</code> gets set to that returned value, which in this case is <code>50</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"interpreting-our-code\">Interpreting our code</h3>\n<p>Everyone should behave a little bit like an interpreter when reading code. Going through your code in the right order and resolving\nexpressions and operations is not something that comes naturally, but with time and practice. So let&#39;s practice</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s use this function we just made, <code>multiplyNumberByTen</code> - and play around with it a little bit.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">let numberResult = multiplyNumberByTen(1) + multiplyNumberByTen(3) * multiplyNumberByTen(2);\n\nfunction multiplyNumberByTen(aNumber){\n  return aNumber * 10;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So the first thing to note here is that we are using this function more than once. That&#39;s good! A good function can be used\nmultiple times, and in fact that&#39;s one of the main reasons we try and aim for what we call &#39;pure functions&#39; - because pure functions\nare always more reusable.</p>\n<p>Here we are using this multiplying function 3 times, and we are doing some math with them. Let&#39;s look at this differently,\nwe know that this function takes a number, multiplies it by 10 and returns it - so if we pass in <code>1</code> - the result is <code>1</code>, if we\npass in <code>3</code> the result is <code>30</code> and <code>2</code> would be <code>20</code>. So another way to view this, is like so</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">let numberResult = 10 + 30 * 20;\n</code></pre>\n<p>At first glance you might think &#39;oh easy, this is equal to 800&#39; - because 10 + 30 = 40, and 40 <em> 20 = 800. However, \nthe rules of math that we know and love apply here - there is an order of operations that we need to consider, on -top- of how the interpreter\nreads this code. So the answer instead is `10 + (30 </em> 20)<code>, which is</code>10 + 600<code>, ie,</code>610`.</p>\n<p>At this point, we start to see how interesting it can get to work with functions, so let&#39;s kick it up a notch.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">let numberResult = multiplyNumberByTen(multiplyNumberByTen(2) + 2);\n\nfunction multiplyNumberByTen(aNumber){\n  return aNumber * 10;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now this might start to look a bit intimidating, but let&#39;s break it down and demystify. We have an expression being passed into\na function call it looks like! Not only that, part of the expression is a function itself - how does this all work, what is the order?</p>\n<p>Well, one thing to remember, is that before any variables or expressions are passed into a function as an argument, they need to be resolved\nfirst, so it&#39;s a good idea to start there, specifically <code>multiplyNumberByTen(2) + 2</code> - this is the expression that we need to resolve first.</p>\n<p>Looking at the previous explanation, we can figure out that the result if this is <code>20 + 2</code>, ie <code>22</code>. At this point, we have a nice number we can pass into\nour function, which ends up returning <code>222</code>;</p>\n<h3 id=\"functions-as-callbacks-\">Functions as &#39;callbacks&#39;</h3>\n<p>Something to always remember is that there is a difference between a function definition and a function being &#39;executed&#39; or &#39;called&#39;.\nThat seems pretty basic, but it can really get confusing when we get into the idea of passing around function definitions. Let&#39;s take a look\nat an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">let helloWorld = function(name){\n  console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);\n}\n\nconsole.log(helloWorld);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Above, the result of the console log is just going to be the definition of the function, try something like this in your browser console\nwindow if you like, and you&#39;ll see that a function&#39;s definition can be passed around - and in fact this is something you&#39;ve done\nall the time in javascript, and if you&#39;re like me, you had no idea what exactly was happening. Let&#39;s explain with another example</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">\nfunction hollerBackFunc(callBackFunction){\n  return callBackFunction(10);\n}\n\nconst doubler = (num) =&gt; num * 2;\nconst addFive = (num) =&gt; num + 5;\nconst squarer = (num) =&gt; num * num;\n\nconst result1 = hollerBackFunc(doubler); \\\\ 20\nconst result2 = hollerBackFunc(addFive); \\\\ 15\nconst result3 = hollerBackFunc(squarer); \\\\ 100\n</code></pre>\n<p>What is happening here!? Let&#39;s take it a step at a time. First, let&#39;s note that we have a bunch of functions defined here,\nspecifically <code>hollerBackFunc</code>,<code>doubler</code>, <code>addFive</code> and <code>squarer</code>. The last 3 are more or less self explanatory, but if the arrows are giving you trouble:\nhttps:\\developer.mozilla.org\\en\\docs\\Web\\JavaScript\\Reference\\Functions\\Arrow_functions\nAnd feel free to ask for help if they still give you trouble!</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s take a look at <code>hollerBackFunc</code>. This function looks mostly familiar, but the weirdest thing about it is that\nit seems to be executing one of it&#39;s parameters as though it were a function - well that&#39;s because it is. Functions can expect almost anything\nto get passed into them. That means arrays, numbers, strings, objects and yes - function definitions. Now unlike a function that has\nalready been called and is resolved before being passed in, an &#39;uncalled&#39; function is passed in as is. So in the case of\n<code>hollerBackFunc</code> - the first parameter it can expect is a function. Additionally, this function is then called <strong>inside</strong>\n<code>hollerBackfunc</code>, and 10 is always passed into whatever it gets. The result if <strong>that</strong> is then returned. So let&#39;s take a look at\nthat with <code>doubler</code>.</p>\n<p><code>doubler</code> takes any number passed in, and doubles it, then returns the result - easy peasy. So with the line</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">const result1 = hollerBackFunc(doubler); \\\\20\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>doubler</code> replaces the parameter <code>callBackFunction</code> inside of <code>hollerBackFunc</code>. So let&#39;s imagine that instead of <code>callBackFunction</code>,\nwe have <code>doubler</code>. It should look something like this in your head:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">function hollerBackFunc(\\is now doubler*\\){\n  return (num =&gt; num * 2)(10);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I cheated a bit and just wrote the definition of doubler inline, wrapped it in parenthesis and passed 10 into it. The reality is,\nthat is more or less what is happening. If you try copying <code>(num =&gt; num * 2)(10)</code> and pasting it in the console, you&#39;ll see it works.</p>\n<p>Now the result of that is 20, and that is returned out to the result of hollerBackFunc! We&#39;ll be approaching this idea\nrepeatedly throughout the course, so don&#39;t be perturbed if it doesn&#39;t immediately click, but still feel free to ask for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recursion-\">Recursion!</h3>\n<p>Here is a very simple example of recursion.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">function subtractByNumUntilANegative(startingNumber, numberToSubtractBy){\n\n  let newTotal = startingNumber - numberToSubtractBy;\n\n  return newTotal &lt; 0 ? newTotal : subtractByNumUntilANegative(newTotal, numberToSubtractBy);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"contents":{"data":{}},"title":"Immutability","path":"1-Javascript-General-Topics/immutability","id":"immutability","body":"<h2 id=\"object-immutability\">Object Immutability</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>First, lets remember that we can have multiple variables all <code>pointing</code> to the same object</li>\n<li>When this happens changing something in the copy seemingly changes something in the original too</li>\n</ul>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/ReasonableWebbedCygnet?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In the above example, the original object has been mutated!</li>\n<li>This is because Javascript likes to have objects sharing references</li>\n<li>There are ways around this</li>\n</ul>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/HarshDizzyElephant?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Here we can use Object.assign to force a new reference in memory, it shallow merges all arguments (which are objects)</li>\n<li>When using object assign, the FIRST object is the final reference in memory, use a new object literal <code>{}</code> for a new reference</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"primitive-immutability\">Primitive Immutability</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>All Primitives are immutable!

What <em>actually</em> happens after you hit save and run your code?</p>\n<p>Some programming languages (like Java and C#) are compiled, translated from <em>source code</em> written by developers into <em>machine code</em> the computer can read. But JavaScript isn&#39;t compiled - it is interpreted. So to understand how the code you write impacts the way your program works, it&#39;s important to know how your code is &#39;read&#39;, and what is doing the reading.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basics\">Basics</h2>\n<p>Your JavaScript code is a set of instructions for the interpreter. We call these instructions &#39;statements&#39;, which we separate with a semicolon and the interpreter reads from left to right.</p>\n<p>Unlike some other languages, JavaScript will still be interpreted with or without the semicolon. Despite this, Mozilla&#39;s developer docs recommend that semicolons are always used. You can read more about that here: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_Types\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_Types</a></p>\n<p>To store values, JavaScript has seven data types, six of which are called primitives, and one called Object. Read on to learn how values are stored, and the differences between types!</p>\n<h2 id=\"variables\">Variables</h2>\n<p>In JavaScript, data is stored in an identifier called a <strong>variable</strong>. A variable represents the name you will use through out your application to store some data. A variable can be declared a number of ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>const</code>\nUsed for decaring a read-only, block-scoped value. Variables declared with <code>const</code> are constants, meaning they cannot be reassigned</li>\n<li><code>let</code>\nUsed for declaring a local, block-scoped variable. Can be reassigned.</li>\n<li><p><code>var</code>\nUsed for declaring a variable. Can be reassinged.</p>\n<p>In addition to being able to reassign their values, both <code>let</code> and <code>var</code> declarations can be used <em>before</em> a value is assigned to them, but <code>const</code> must be given a value upon declaration or an error is thrown.</p>\n<pre><code>var name; // works\nlet nextValue; // works\nconst studentName; // will throw error: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration`\n</code></pre><p>Variables can hold a variety of data, including primitives and Objects.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-primitives-\">What are primitives?</h2>\n<p>JavaScript&#39;s six primitive types are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boolean - can have value <code>true</code> or <code>false</code></li>\n<li>Null - value is <code>null</code></li>\n<li>Undefined - no value been assigned, and so has the value of  <code>undefined</code></li>\n<li>Number - value is a number**</li>\n<li>String - accepts textual data enclosed in quotes.</li>\n<li>Symbol - this is the newest data type, introduced in ECMAScript 6. It can be used as the key of an object property</li>\n</ul>\n<p>** Number accepts more than just integers: it can also represent floating-point numbers, NaN and <code>+Infinity and -Inifinity</code>. You can read more about the Number type and other data structures here: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-are-primitives-interpreted-\">How are primitives interpreted?</h2>\n<p>When the JavaScript interpreter encounters a variable, it first reads at the left-hand side of the expression (the part before the equals sign), then it assigns the right-hand side of the expression to the value on the left. So in the intance below, the variable <code>song</code> is assinged the value <code>Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>  const song = &#39;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&#39;\n  console.log(song) // will return &#39;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&#39;\n</code></pre><p>JavaScript&#39;s primitive types are <strong>immutable</strong>, meaning they store their values directly on the variable, like in this example:</p>\n<p>``` let hero = &quot;Leia&quot;\n    let hero2 = hero;\n    hero = &quot;General Organa&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>console.log(hero2) // Leia\nconsole.log(hero) // General Organa\n</code></pre><pre><code>\nWhen we write the line `hero = &quot;General Organa&quot;`, we want to make the value of `hero` a new string. But when we `console.log(hero2)`, we&#39;re given the value `Leia`. Why? Because when we wrote `let hero2 = hero`, we stored the actual, current value of `hero` into the `hero2` variable. Later, when the value of `hero` is changed, our `hero2` variable doesn&#39;t change along with it.\n\n\n## Interpreting Objects\n\nA JavaScript object is a collection of key-value pairs known as &#39;properties&#39;. An object looks like this:\n</code></pre><p>let heroObject = {\n    name: &#39;Leia&#39;,\n    age: 60,\n    planet: &#39;Alderaan&#39;,\n    affliations: [&#39;Rebel Alliance&#39;,  &#39;Galactic Republic&#39;, &#39;Alderaan Royal Family&#39;, &#39;The Resistance&#39;]\n}</p>\n<pre><code>Unlike primitives, a JavaScript object is a complex data type and is **mutable**. This means if we make a change similiar to the primitive example above, we&#39;ll get different outputs in the console:\n</code></pre><p>​var heroObject2 = heroObject;\nheroObject.name = &quot;General Organa&quot;;\n​\nconsole.log(heroObject2.name); // General Organa\nconsole.log(heroObject.name); // General Organa</p>\n<pre><code>\nSo why didn&#39;t our first call return `Leia` like above? Because an object&#39;s values are stored as references rather than actual values. You can think of references like URLs: they&#39;re a *pointer* to some information, rather than the information itself. If the information stored on the pointer changes, every instance (whether URL or variable name) will now point to this new information.\n\n## Execution in the Browser\n\nJavaScript engines evaluate code as follows:\n\n1. Global function and variable declarations are defined and processed\n2. Separate execution contexts are created for each function\n3. Functions, variables and arguments inside each execution contexts are created (and new execution contexts are created for any function found inside another function)\n4. Assignment statements are executed\n\nIf the interpreter encounters any errors during this process, it stops. Any lines evaluated before the errors occured will remain evaluated, and any code following the errors will not be read.\nComments that are written into your code will also be ignored by the interpreter.\n\n(For an in-depth look at the above process, see: http://davidshariff.com/blog/what-is-the-execution-context-in-javascript/)\n\n## Hoisting\n\nJavaScript interpreters move function and variable declarations to the top of their scope as the code is run - this is called &#39;hoisting&quot;. Because of hoisting, you are able to use a function or reference a variable *before* it is defined in code. For example:\n</code></pre><p>favouriteFood(&quot;ice cream&quot;);</p>\n<p>function favouriteFood(food) {\n  console.log(&quot;My favourite food is &quot; + food); // will return &#39;My favourite food is ice cream&quot;\n}</p>\n<pre><code>\nHoisting can also lead to some tricky errors to debug. A **declaration**, like the function declaration above, will be hoisted. An **expression** behaves differently:\n</code></pre><p>favouriteFood2(&quot;beans&quot;)</p>\n<p>var favouriteFood2 = function(food) {\n  console.log(&quot;My favourite food is &quot; + food);\n}</p>\n<p>// returns favouriteFood2 is not a function</p>\n<pre><code>\nSo what&#39;s happening here? The answer is that only *part* of the function expression is hoisted - the left side of the assignment is put into memory, but the interpreter recognizes the right side as an assignment statement and skips it (to come back later).\nThis results in a confusing error, since we *have* defined `favouriteFood2`...just not in the order we needed to.\n\nUsing the keyword `let` instead of `var` with this example returns a new error:\n</code></pre><p>favouriteFood3(&quot;pineapple&quot;)</p>\n<p>let favouriteFood3 = function(food) {\n  console.log(&quot;My favourite food is &quot; + food);\n}</p>\n<p>// returns favouriteFood3 is not defined</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>This error is more helpful, since it tells us there&#39;s a specific problem with our variable - it isn&#39;t defined by the time the interpreter is reading it.</p>\n<p>Understanding hoisting can be tricky, but it will help you avoid many errors in your code. An excellent explanation (with pictures!) can be found here: <a href=\"https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-hoisting-in-javascript\">https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-hoisting-in-javascript</a></p>\n"},{"contents":{"data":{}},"title":"Js Eventloop","path":"1-Javascript-General-Topics/js-eventloop","id":"js-eventloop","body":"<h1 id=\"the-javascript-event-loop\">The JavaScript Event Loop</h1>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-it-\">What is it?</h2>\n<p>Modern browsers have JavaScript engines that handle executing JavaScript using a model called the event loop. The event loop runs on a single thread - it only works on one thing at a time. It consist of three parts: stack, heap, and queue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://postimg.org/image/1759o89x23/\"><img src=\"https://s1.postimg.org/3k7w5fnq8v/async----event_loop.jpg\" alt=\"async----event_loop.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>The basic idea is: during runtime, there are messages/tasks that are being created, lining up in a queue, and being processed one by one by the JavaScript engine. When a message is being processed, it uses the stack and heap to manage stuff the stuff it&#39;s doing - kind of like its own personal workspace. While a message is being processed, it may create other messages to be put into the queue. </p>\n<h3 id=\"heap\">Heap</h3>\n<p>The heap is just a mostly unstructured region where memory for objects is allocated. </p>\n<h3 id=\"stack\">Stack</h3>\n<p>The stack manages function calls at runtime. You can think of it as stacked <em>frames</em>, where each frame is a reference to a spot in some function scope. A frame is created when a function is called, and is removed when that function has completed. It might be helpful to think of a stack of blocks: the most immediate block you&#39;re dealing with is always the top block. That is, you add and remove blocks from the top (unless you&#39;re playing a game of Jenga).</p>\n<p>Below is a great example taken from <a href=\"http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_async.html#sec_javascript-call-stack\">Exploring JS</a> to demonstrate the stack.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s look at this code:</p>\n<pre><code>function h(z) {\n    // Print stack trace\n    console.log(new Error().stack); // (A)\n}\nfunction g(y) {\n    h(y + 1); // (B)\n}\nfunction f(x) {\n    g(x + 1); // (C)\n}\nf(3); // (D)\nreturn; // (E)\n</code></pre><p>Initially, when the program above is started, the call stack is empty. After the function call f(3) in line D, the stack has one entry:</p>\n<pre><code>|----------|\n| Location |\n| in global|\n| scope    |\n|----------|\n</code></pre><p>After the function call g(x + 1) in line C, the stack has two entries:</p>\n<pre><code>|----------|\n| Location |\n|  in f    |\n|          |\n|----------|\n| Location |\n| in global|\n| scope    |\n|----------|\n</code></pre><p>After the function call h(y + 1) in line B, the stack has three entries:</p>\n<pre><code>|----------|\n| Location |\n|  in g    |\n|          |\n|----------|\n| Location |\n|  in f    |\n|          |\n|----------|\n| Location |\n| in global|\n| scope    |\n|----------|\n</code></pre><p>The stack trace printed in line A shows you what the call stack looks like:</p>\n<pre><code>Error\n    at h (stack_trace.js:2:17)\n    at g (stack_trace.js:6:5)\n    at f (stack_trace.js:9:5)\n    at &lt;global&gt; (stack_trace.js:11:1)\n</code></pre><p>Next, each of the functions terminates and each time, the top entry is removed from the stack. After function f is done, we are back in global scope and the call stack is empty. In line E we return and the stack is empty, which means that the program terminates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"queue\">Queue</h3>\n<p>The queue is a place where messages line up to be processed during runtime. A message is like a task item (sidenote: they are often called tasks). Every message has an associated function. A message is processed when:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is at the front of the queue (first in line) </li>\n<li>The previous message is completely done being processed</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Only one message is processed at a time. The processing consists of calling the associated function, which creates the initial stack frame. That function will do its business and eventually complete aka be terminated and removed from the stack. The processing is completed when the stack is empty again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-are-messages-added-to-the-queue-\">When are messages added to the queue?</h2>\n<p>There are various things during runtime that are added to the queue as messages (for example, reaction to user input such as click). In the case of asynchronous tasks: if an async task is called and has an associated callback function, a message with the associated callback function will be put at the <strong>end</strong> of the queue <strong>after</strong> the task has completed and returned. That means the callback function will never be executed before the current message (the one that called the async task), is completed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"an-example\">An example</h2>\n<p>Let&#39;s look at an example. When you run this JS code, what do you expect to see in your console (in what order will the statements print)?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">console.log(&#39;script start&#39;);\n\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  console.log(&#39;hello!&#39;);\n}, 0);\n\nconsole.log(&#39;script end&#39;);\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://repl.it/OBrd/0\">Try it out yourself</a></p>\n<p>It turns out they print in this order:</p>\n<pre><code>script start\nscript end\nhello!\n</code></pre><p>Why doesn&#39;t <code>hello!</code> print before <code>script end</code> if the <code>setTimeout</code> comes before the last <code>console.log</code> and has a delay of 0 milliseconds?</p>\n<p><code>setTimeout</code> is an asynchronous function. The delay you give it does not set the amount of time before the callback function executes, but rather, the minimum amount of time before the callback function can be added to the queue. Remember that only one message can be processed at a time and it must complete before the next message is processed.</p>\n<p>So in this example, this program starts and is on the call stack. <code>console.log</code> is executed synchronously so it logs &#39;script start&#39;. Then comes the <code>setTimeout</code> which puts the logging callback function into the queue. The current program continues, logging &#39;script end&#39;. Then it is completed and popped off the stack - the message is terminated. Only then can the next message in the queue (the callback that logs &#39;hello!&#39;) be processed. </p>\n"},{"contents":{"data":{}},"title":"Promises","path":"1-Javascript-General-Topics/promises","id":"promises","body":"<h2 id=\"promises\">Promises</h2>\n<p>Promises are now officially in Javascript, as of ES2015! So we should probably try and figure out what promises are.</p>\n<p>First, let&#39;s talk about the problem that Promises are solving. In javascript, asynchronous code (that&#39;s code that does not immediately fire)\nhas always been complicated and difficult to deal with. Today there are a lot of different methods to do so, there are Promises, Observables, Generators and often a combination of all of these and more.\nSo what are these systems, tools and libraries trying to do? Well, let&#39;s talk about just how javascript <strong>runs</strong>. </p>\n<p>In Javascript, code is run in a single threaded manner (let&#39;s not get into WebWorkers right now) - meaning, that all code is run by the \nsame thread of thought, so to speak. That means everything needs to queue up and wait it&#39;s turn, and no skipping in the line.</p>\n<p>This get&#39;s complicated when you have async code. Let&#39;s take a look at <code>setTimeout</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">const someValue = &#39;Hello&#39;;\nlet theSecondHalf = &#39;&#39;;\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; theSecondHalf = &#39;World&#39;, 0);\nconsole.log(someValue + theSecondHalf);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Well, looking at this code, some might intuitively think &quot;well, we have someValue equalling Hello, theSecondHalf being blank\nat first but on the next line we give it a value, then right after that we give it a value of &#39;world&#39; so then on the last line it should say &#39;HelloWorld&#39; in the console.&quot;.</p>\n<p>The reasoning above seems right, but this is where the complicated nature of async code comes in. SetTimeout, no matter what, is an asynchronous action. That means no matter what,\nthe function inside is <strong>not</strong> part of the immediate stack. It get&#39;s put in the queue and is called at the next available opportunity (when the current stack clears).</p>\n<p>So that means that <code>console.log()</code> fires <em>before</em> the function that sets <code>theSecondHalf</code> to &#39;World&#39; does.</p>\n<p>Now this can be annoying, especially if I don&#39;t have any control over when the async event is firing - like with a network request. So promises are a way to communicate better with these\nasync events. Now, what we do, is wait for our async events.</p>\n<h3 id=\"our-first-promise\">Our first promise</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">let myPromise = new Promise((res, rej) =&gt; setTimeout(()=&gt; res(&#39;yay&#39;), 3000));\n\nmyPromise.then(response =&gt; console.log(response));\n</code></pre>\n<p>So let&#39;s break this down a little bit. First, let&#39;s take a look at this <code>new</code> keyword. We seem to be calling it right in front of a function - and this tells us the function is a <code>constructor</code>.\nI won&#39;t get into the details of what that entails, but just know that a constructor is a special kind of function that always returns an object. This object, in this case, is a <code>Promise</code>. So that means\nthat &#39;myPromise&#39; ends up equalling a promise object, which comes with a few useful methods, one of which we&#39;ll get into later.</p>\n<p>Now this promise is getting something passed into it - and that is a function, specifically:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">(res, rej) =&gt; setTimeout(()=&gt; res(&#39;yay&#39;), 3000)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is passed into the Promise, and it is a callback function, which if you remember is a function definition passed into another function. Additionally,\nany function you pass into a Promise constructor can expect two parameters to be passed in. This is where it gets tricky - the two parameters that you can expect are\n<strong><em>also</em></strong> functions. You can see that in this example, we are even calling one of them, <code>res</code>. If you&#39;re not confused at this point, congratulations, you&#39;re a loooot smarter than me. This can get really dicey,\n and this is why we&#39;ll continue to go over the fundamentals of a function. Anyway, this res - what is it doing? Well we can see that inside of the callback function above,\n we are calling <code>setTimeout</code>, and waiting 3 seconds (3000ms) before firing the res function inside. So what that looks like is, 3 seconds after we create the function,\n <code>res</code> is fired, and additionally, it is provided the value <code>&#39;yay&#39;</code>. So that looks cool - but how does that practically change or do anything? Well this is where we get \n back to that <code>myPromise</code> variable:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">myPromise.then(response =&gt; console.log(response));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Right here, we can see that myPromise, the promise object returned by the promise constructor, has a cool function that comes with it called <code>then</code>. We didn&#39;t define this, all\npromises come with it. What <code>then</code> does can be a little confusing, because we can see that it <strong><em>also expects a callback</em></strong>. This callback function has one specific purpose though.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-then-doing-\">What is &#39;then&#39; doing?</h3>\n<p>So <code>then</code> takes a function as it&#39;s first (and second, but we&#39;ll get into it later), parameter. <em>This function get&#39;s called right after the resolve in the promise constructor get&#39;s called</em>. Meaning, in the \nexample above, it get&#39;s called 3 seconds after myPromise get&#39;s defined! You can also see that this callback function expects something as well, and we are console logging that result.</p>\n<p>Can you guess what that result is? It&#39;s &#39;yay&#39;! That same string I passed in the constructor is available, three seconds later, in this function.</p>\n<p>This may seem a bit useless, and in this example it really is, but when we get to RESTful calls, you&#39;ll see it&#39;s value. In the next less on promises, we&#39;ll talk about the <code>reject</code> that we conveniently avoided today!</p>\n"},{"contents":{"data":{"layout":"lesson","title":"Filter","permalink":"/filter/"}},"title":"Array Filter","path":"2-Working-With-Arrays/array-filter","id":"array-filter","body":"<h2 id=\"imagine-trying-to-filter-out-numbers-from-a-list-less-than-18\">Imagine trying to filter out numbers from a list, less than 18</h2>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/CostlySnowPinemarten?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 id=\"challenges\">Challenges</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Takes multiple lines to handle even the simplest filters</li>\n<li>Can be hard to quickly understand what is happening</li>\n<li>Complexity increases significantly with more complex conditions</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-array-filter-\">What is Array.filter?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A functional programming tool found natively in javascript</li>\n<li>Creates a new array based off the data in a base array</li>\n<li>Does not modify the original array</li>\n<li>Only the items from the original array that pass a test are copied into a new array</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work-\">How does it work?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>With the same example as above</li>\n</ul>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/GainsboroLittleYellowwhitebutterfly?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>filter</code> exists as a method on all arrays, it takes one uncalled function as an argument</li>\n<li>This uncalled function is called for each item in the array, as filter iterates over each item</li>\n<li>This function is provided the value currently being iterated over as the first parameter, in the above\ncase, that means that <code>eachAge</code> represents <code>22</code> the first time it is called, then <code>12</code>, and then <code>43</code> and so on.</li>\n<li>This function expects either a <code>true</code> or a <code>false</code> to be returned inside of it.</li>\n<li>In the above example, the first time <code>eachAge</code> is equal to <code>22</code>, and <code>22 &gt;= 18</code> resolves to <code>true</code>.

We make a request for the data on the side and, once the data arrives, we put it in a queue to be processed. We don&#39;t actually stop and hold up all activity in the app until the data comes back. Instead, we put it to the side and process it when it arrives (and when we&#39;re ready) - [<em>insert link to event loop bridge content here</em>].</p>\n<p>We also encounter this with DOM events, timer intervals, web workers and web sockets.</p>\n<p><strong>Don&#39;t we already have a few ways to handle asynchronous data?</strong> \nYes, we can use callback functions and promises for example. But Observables are slightly different as they allow us to process <strong>streams of data</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-should-i-care-\">Why should I care?</h2>\n<p>Observables play a key part in something called <strong>reactive programming</strong>. This is the concept of programming with asynchronous data streams (a sequence of values in time). You can choose to listen to these streams and, as data comes through them, react accordingly. </p>\n<p>Data streams are functional - so you can use streams as inputs into other streams, combine them, filter them, etc using a variety of helpful functions. </p>\n<p>Angular has Observables baked into core parts of its library, such as its event system and HTTP client service, using a third-party library called RxJS (Reactive Extensions). In addition, we&#39;re starting to see more React projects use RxJS to take advantage of Observables to manage streams.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-an-observable-\">What is an Observable?</h2>\n<p>Observables originate from something called the <strong>observer design pattern</strong>. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the <strong>subject</strong>, maintains a list of its dependents, called <strong>observers</strong>, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern\">source</a>) </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ok, so that definition is pretty wordy and technical. </p>\n<p>In simple terms, the pattern involves an object (called an observable) that will share (or emit) data as it arrives over time. Throughout your code, many different objects (called observers) can sign up to be notified when that data arrives (called subscribing). So, whenever our observable recieves its data, it will broadcast that information out and the observers will be listening for it.  </p>\n<p>Some key points to note about the pattern:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can have one observable and many observers (a one-to-many dependancy). That is, one broadcaster and an unlimited number of recipients.</li>\n<li>When that observable changes, all observers should be updated/notified immediately and automatically</li>\n<li>It is the observer&#39;s responsibility to register and unregister themselves from the observable (to be notified of changes) and to update their own state when notified.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"so-an-observable-\">So... an Observable?</h2>\n<p>Think of an observable as a box that you create to hold data from a service or function whose data or items will arrive over time. </p>\n<p>As the data arrives, the box notifies anyone that has requested they be updated and it does so in the way they&#39;ve asked.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basic-structure\">Basic structure</h2>\n<p>In its simpliest form, an Observable is a function that accepts an object (an observer) with next, error and complete methods on it. </p>\n<p>When you create an observable, you call its constructor and pass in a function. That function takes in an observer as a parameter and its body contains instructions for when to call each of the observer&#39;s methods. </p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">const data = Observable.create(observer =&gt; {\n  setTimeout(() =&gt; observer.next(&#39;first&#39;), 1000);\n  setTimeout(() =&gt; observer.complete(), 3000);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>The newly created observable doesn&#39;t actually do anything until: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>a) someone subscribes and passes in an observer and </li>\n<li>b) data is emitted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you subscribe to an observable, this is the equivilant to calling the observable like a function and passing in an observer.

repository onto your local machine. You&#39;re interested in making some changes to it, then eventually requesting that your changes be merged back into that repository. How do you get there?</p>\n<p>A good place to start is always to check the state of your files.</p>\n<p>Make sure you&#39;re in the directory that you cloned locally, then type in the command: \n<code>git status</code>. \nYou&#39;ll see something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>On branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n</code></pre><p>Ok... cool. What does that mean? </p>\n<h2 id=\"branching\">Branching</h2>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-branching-\">What is branching?</h3>\n<p>When you branch, you diverge from the main line of development so that you can work on some changes without affecting the main line. </p>\n<h3 id=\"when-do-i-branch-\">When do I branch?</h3>\n<p>You&#39;ll typically create new branches when you&#39;re developing a feature or putting in a fix. Keeping your changes organized and separated into branches will allow you to work faster overall and with less complications. It also makes it easier to get your code reviewed. When your PRs contain smaller, focused packages of code, a reviewer doesn&#39;t need to spend as much time contextualizing or making sense of your changes - this leads to more efficient reviews!</p>\n<p>For example, let&#39;s say your project&#39;s main branch is <code>master</code> and it is the &#39;source of truth&#39; of the state of your live app- everything that is merged into this branch should be ready to be online. Now let&#39;s say there are two new features you want to add to your project. If the features are not dependent on each other, this is a good opportunity to create a new branch for each of them. </p>\n<p>Why not make one new branch and work on both of them there? Here&#39;s one reason: what if you do, but after you&#39;ve started making changes for both features, you decide that you don&#39;t want feature #1 anymore? Now you have some unwanted changes scattered among your files, and you have to spend time finding and undoing those changes without messing with any of the changes that are related to feature #2. If you had just separated the features into their own branches, you could just scrap the branch for feature #1 and be done with it! </p>\n<p>Why not work on them in master? The same as above, plus the added risk of making changes directly to the branch that reflects your live app (it could break). </p>\n<h3 id=\"ok-cool-how-do-i-create-switch-branches-\">Ok cool. How do I create/switch branches?</h3>\n<p>Let&#39;s say you want to create a new branch for a feature called <code>favourites</code>. To <strong>create</strong> this new branch locally and switch to it, use this command:</p>\n<pre><code>$ git checkout -b favourites\n</code></pre><p>That will give me a message that says:</p>\n<pre><code>Switched to a new branch &#39;favourites&#39;\n</code></pre><p>Now to <strong>display a list</strong> of what branches you have locally, use the command <code>git branch</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>* favourites\n  master\n</code></pre><p>The star denotes what branch you are currently on (favourites here). \nTo <strong>switch</strong> back to the master branch, just use the command: </p>\n<pre><code>$ git checkout master\n</code></pre><p>That&#39;s pretty much it, just replace the branch names in the above commands to whatever branches you are creating or switching to. </p>\n<h2 id=\"staging\">Staging</h2>\n<p>After you&#39;ve made the changes in your branch, it is time to stage those changes.\nLet&#39;s say that in your <code>favourites</code> branch, you created a new file called <code>constants.js</code> and you modified a file called <code>index.js</code>. If you check the state of your files using the command <code>git status</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>On branch favourites\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)\n  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)\n\n    modified:   index.js\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)\n\n    constants.js\n\nno changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)\n</code></pre><p>Here, <code>constants.js</code> is listed as an untracked file because it is new, meaning it was not part of the previous commit, and therefore is not being tracked yet. After this file is included in a commit, it will be tracked. </p>\n<p>Ok, so let&#39;s <strong>stage</strong> the changes for both of these files. You can do them individually using the command found in the above message, or do them both using the command: </p>\n<pre><code>git add .\n</code></pre><p>Now if you check the state of your files using <code>git status</code> again, you&#39;ll see this:</p>\n<pre><code>On branch favourites\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)\n\n    modified:   index.js\n    new file:   constants.js\n</code></pre><p>Now both file changes are staged to be committed. </p>\n<h2 id=\"committing\">Committing</h2>\n<p>When you make a commit, you essentially take a snapshot of the state of all the files in the directory at that point in time. This is the basis of tracking changes in git. To make a commit, use this command and include a descriptive message of what the commit does:</p>\n<pre><code>git commit -m &quot;Add constants file and import to favourites index&quot;\n</code></pre><p>You&#39;ll see something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>[favourites ecdc873] Add constants file and import to favourites index\n 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)\n create mode 100644 constants.js\n</code></pre><p>Now your staged changes have been committed! (Note: unstaged changes will not be included in the commit). Commit often to make life easier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recap\">Recap</h2>\n<p>Here are the basic steps: </p>\n<pre><code>// 1. Create and switch to new branch:\ngit checkout -b [branch_name_here]\n\n// 2. Make changes to your files\n\n// 3. Stage the changes you want to commit\ngit add [file_name_here]\n\n// 4.

You might want to introduce features that are outside the scope of the project. You may want to build something completely unrelated and just use the repository as a starting point. Maybe a useful library needs a bug fix, but the maintainer has abandoned the repository. </p>\n<p>For all these times and <a href=\"#why-would-we-want-a-fork\">more</a>, there&#39;s <strong>Forking</strong>!</p>\n<p>Read on, or <a href=\"#the-short-version\">skip to the short version</a>!</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-fork-\">What is a Fork?</h2>\n<p>Forking is creating a new copy of the entire repository. This might sound like <code>git clone</code>, and behind the scenes it is. The difference is in where the new copy resides. A &quot;clone&quot; typically refers to a <em>local</em> copy of some repository. A <em>fork</em>, in contrast, is a second <em>remote</em> repository distinct from the original.</p>\n<p>Historically, a <em>fork</em> was created when a developer or team wanted to take a project in a new direction, or carry on the original mission while the core project undergoes some major shift. Some examples of this are <a href=\"http://anandmanisankar.com/posts/nodejs-iojs-why-the-fork/#why-the-fork\">NodeJS being forked as IO.js</a>, or when Oracle&#39;s take over of <code>OpenOffice</code> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice#ooo-build,_Go-oo_and_Oracle\">led to the LibreOffice fork</a>, and ultimately OpenOffice&#39;s demise. These classic situations can be referred to as <strong>hard forks</strong>, where the forked code is not meant to be integrated back into the original (upstream) codebase. What we deal with most often are so called <strong>soft forks</strong>, where we <em>do</em> intend for our changes to be integrated back into the original repository, and the fork is a convenient system for creating an isolated workspace. From here on when we say &quot;fork&quot; we will be talking about soft forks, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-make-a-fork-\">How do I make a fork?</h2>\n<p>You can do this manually by cloning a repository locally and then pushing to a new remote repository in a place of your choosing (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc). You would do so like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">$&gt; git clone git@github.com:some-account/some-repo.git\n$&gt; git remote add myfork git@github.com:fork-account/fork-repo.git\n$&gt; git push myfork master\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: more about <a href=\"#dealing-with-multiple-remotes\">managing <code>remote</code>s</a> below.</p>\n<p>GitHub and most other git-based version control services have forking built in as a feature that will automatically create a new repository under your account and copy the source repository into your new repository.</p>\n<p>On GitHub, for example, this can be accomplished simply by clicking the &quot;Fork&quot; button in the top right corner, just under your account avatar. See here:\n<img src=\"../images/github-fork.png\" alt=\"Forking on GitHub\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"why-would-we-want-a-fork-\">Why would we want a fork?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"why-not-just-branch-\">Why not just branch?</h3>\n<p>So far we have mostly discussed the reasons one may want or need to create a <em>hard</em> fork of some project, where we intend on making permanently incompatible changes, but we have not justified our more typical (soft) fork situation. As you recall, this is for work which we want to eventually merge back into the main repository. Some reasons for doing this are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User workspaces:</strong> some projects involve a large number of developers (imagine a popular open source or large enterprise project) and if every developer pushes multiple branches of their work to the same repository, that repository can become very cluttered. When you synchronize your local instance in those cases, you will have many more branches listed than you need or care about as you&#39;ll see branches for everybody&#39;s work.</li>\n<li><strong>Clean main repository:</strong> as in the above case, but even for smaller teams, often the main repository is kept as the source-of-truth for the <code>master</code> (or <code>develop</code>) branch, and is otherwise reserved for CI and CD tasks, such as preserving production release versions. Branches for work-in-progress are relegated to user forks only in order to keep the central repo tidy.</li>\n<li><strong>Experimental changes:</strong> Sometimes you need to make large architectural changes or adjust CI/CD configuration, and it isn&#39;t acceptable to block work on the main repo. Configuring another pipeline against a fork is one option to get around this.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"dealing-with-multiple-remote-s\">Dealing with multiple <code>remote</code>s</h2>\n<p>When you set up your local repository with multiple <code>remote</code> repositories (usually the main repository and your own fork), there are slight changes to some of the <code>git</code> commands you are accustomed to using. Specifically, for any commands that deal with remote repositories (<code>push</code>, <code>pull</code>, <code>fetch</code> etc), you now need to specify the repository with which you want to interact.</p>\n<p>For the following examples, imagine you cloned from your fork, so the repo copy under your account is the remote named <code>origin</code>, and we&#39;ve added a second remote called <code>upstream</code> for the main reposiory.</p>\n<h3 id=\"-pull-\"><code>pull</code></h3>\n<p>When pulling the latest changes for a tracked remote branch, you now specify the full source, including the remote name:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-shell\">$&gt; git pull upstream master\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"-push-\"><code>push</code></h3>\n<p>Now when you push a branch, you will need to specify the target remote by name:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-shell\">$&gt; git push origin my-cool-feature\n</code></pre>\n<p>A common workflow is to push your work-in-progress feature branches to your fork, and then issue a Pull Request from there back to the main repository.</p>\n<h3 id=\"-fetch-\"><code>fetch</code></h3>\n<p>If you want to retrieve all of the latest changes from some remote (usually <code>upstream</code>), you can do so via <code>fetch</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-shell\">$&gt; git fetch upstream\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"-rebase-\"><code>rebase</code></h3>\n<p><em>TBD</em> - should we cover this?</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-short-version\">The Short Version</h2>\n<p>If your team uses forks as part of their flow, after get acess to the main repository you should do the following:\n1) Create a personal fork of the repository on whichever platform the team uses.\n1) Clone <em>your fork</em> locally: <code>git clone git@github.com:your-account/shared-repo.git</code>\n1) Add the main repository as another remote: <code>git remote add upstream git@github.com:repo-owner-account/shared-repo.git</code>\n1) Checkout the <code>master</code> branch\n1) <a href=\"./git-branch-stage-commit.md\">Create a branch</a> for your feature: <code>git checkout -b feat/my-cool-feature</code>\n1) Develop! Commit! Get it to the point where you&#39;re ready to propose merging the code.\n1) Get the latest code from the upstream repo (other code may have been merged): <code>git fetch upstream</code>\n1) <a href=\"git-rebase.md\">Rebase</a> your branch against the latest version of <code>master</code> from <code>upstream</code>: <code>git rebase upstream/master</code>\n  1) Follow the steps, being very careful to resolve any <em>merge conflicts</em> if necessary.\n1) Push your rebased branch to your <code>origin</code>: <code>git push origin feat/my-cool-feature</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"gotchas\">Gotchas</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you will need to rebase your branch after you push it, because somebody else had made a change to the code and you need to update your branch before your PR can be merged. Just <code>fetch</code> the latest changes, and <code>rebase</code> as above. When this happens, you may encounter an error when you go to push your code to your <code>origin</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>ADD ERROR HERE\n</code></pre><p>This is because rebasing <em>changes your commits</em>. Your updated commits (and any new ones) are no longer compatible with the commits you push before. You have to overwrite them:\n<code>git push origin feat/my-cool-feature -f</code>\nThe <code>-f</code> t the end of the commend tells git to do a &quot;force&quot; push, which replaces all the commits that are on the remote branch with your new rebased version.</p>\n<h2 id=\"check-your-understanding\">Check your understanding</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>How is a fork of a repository different than a clone?</li>\n<li>What are some reasons for forking?</li>\n<li>What do we mean by hard and soft forks?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"more-resources\">More resources</h2>\n<p>Some further reading</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/\">GitHub help article</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"TODO\">Atlassian&#39;s explanation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2017/12/11/high-level-problems-with-git-and-how-to-fix-them/\">Another perspective on forks</a></li>\n</ul>\n"},{"contents":{"data":{}},"title":"Git Intro","path":"7-Git/git-intro","id":"git-intro","body":"<h1 id=\"an-intro-to-git\">An intro to Git</h1>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-git-\">What is Git?</h2>\n<p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. It allows you to easily work on files locally, as well as coordinate the work on those files between multiple people. Your local copy of the code is a complete version control repository. You can commit your work locally, then sync your copy of the repository with the copy on a server. This provides a lot of flexibility in terms of working offline, and in a non-linear workflow with a team. </p>\n<p>The basis of tracking changes in Git is commits. Making a commit essentially takes a snapshot of the state of all the files in the directory at that point in time and saves that as a version of your project. If a file has not changed, Git saves a pointer to the previous version of that file. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-is-git-different-from-github-\">How is Git different from GitHub?</h2>\n<p>Git is the version control system, and GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.

Then it takes all of your local commits and applies them on top.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-said-it-merges-the-branches-why-not-use-git-merge-\">You said it merges the branches. Why not use <code>git merge</code>?</h2>\n<p>Git rebase solves the same issues as git merge, but rebasing results in a cleaner, easier to understand commit history (better for everyone trying to understand the history of your project!). Rebasing keeps your history clean by moving your commits to the end of your git history, while git merge makes a merge commit every time you pull upstream changes, but keeps your commits at the same at the same point in history when they were made (resulting in a strange spliting of your changes in your git history). </p>\n<p>tl;dr: git rebase makes your commit history easier to read than git merge. To learn more about the difference between merging and rebasing (with handy diagrams!), check out this link: <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing\">https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing</a>  </p>\n<h2 id=\"when-should-i-rebase-\">When should I rebase?</h2>\n<p>One common reason for rebasing is to get changes from another branch and apply them to your own. Let’s say you and your team are busy working on your project. You’re coding on your local branch when someone else on your team finishes a feature and merges it to master. The new code your friend just pushed is a change you want on your local branch. You can use <code>git rebase &lt;nameOfYourFriendsBranch&gt;</code> to add these changes to your local branch and keep working.</p>\n<p>Another reason to rebase is to head off (or handle!) any potential merge conflicts. A merge conflict occurs when two branches have code edits on the same lines. Git doesn’t know which of the edits should be kept, so it throws a conflict that a human (you!) has to resolve. So if a teammate&#39;s branch is merged before yours and you and your teammate have both touched the same files, your branch could now have merge conflicts. The fix? Rebasing.</p>\n<p>Your team norms might dictate other times you need to rebase - for example, a team might agree that if your branch has <em>any</em> outdated changes from master, you rebase. </p>\n<h2 id=\"merge-conflicts-sound-terrible-how-can-i-make-sure-i-never-have-to-deal-with-them-\">Merge conflicts sound terrible. How can I make sure I never have to deal with them?</h2>\n<p>Alas, dealing with merge conflicts is a part of developer life. But they don’t have to be awful! To mitigate conflicts, commit your work often and rebase master when new code is added. If everyone on your team does this, you’ll keep your local branches up-to-date and lower the entire team&#39;s odds of having to fix a large merge conflict.</p>\n<p>Using the interactive mode when performing a rebase helps as well. Interactive mode can be used by adding the -i flag to your rebase command like so:</p>\n<p> <code>git rebase -i &lt;nameOfBranchToRebaseIn&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Using interactive mode when rebasing lets you see the commits that you&#39;re rebasing, and allows you to edit and squash commits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-git-squash-\">What is git squash?</h2>\n<p>Git squash allows you to take several commits and combine them into a single commit. Say you&#39;ve finished a feature - styling a nav bar - and your git history looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>3f0e9cdcda init commit\n9845111670 in progress\ncd362d2f52 still working\n300571e57c styled nav bar\n</code></pre><p>To keep your git history clean and easy to read, you can combine all of these commits into a single commit and update your commit message. You can do this by rebasing your current branch into itself, and then squashing your commits together, like this:</p>\n<p><code>git rebase -i &lt;nameOfBranchYouAreOn&gt;~4</code></p>\n<p>The reason &quot;4&quot; is added to the end of the rebase message is because your branch currently has 4 commits that you want to make into a single commit. After you run this command, git will show you the commits you&#39;ve selected:</p>\n<pre><code>pick 3f0e9cdcda init commit\npick 9845111670 in progress\npick cd362d2f52 still working\npick 300571e57c styled nav bar\n</code></pre><p>You can squash your commits by keeping the first commit as is, and selecting &#39;squash&#39; for the other commits like so:</p>\n<pre><code>pick 3f0e9cdcda init commit\ns 9845111670 in progress\ns cd362d2f52 still working\ns 300571e57c styled nav bar\n</code></pre><p>Save your choices:\n<code>cmd + s</code>, then <code>cmd+ w</code></p>\n<p>Once you&#39;ve done this, git will give you the option of editing the commit messages for all of the commits you&#39;ve changed. You can edit your commit messages into a single commit that describes the work you&#39;ve done on the branch. When you&#39;re finished editing the messages, save and quit your editor.</p>\n<p>At this point you can push your new, squashed changes. Since you&#39;ve just changed the git history of your branch, you&#39;ll need to force push, so rather than:\n<code>git push</code></p>\n<p>you&#39;ll need:</p>\n<p><code>git push -f</code></p>\n<p>You use the -f flag to force update your git history on your remote branch after you rebase. If you don&#39;t force push your code, you&#39;ll get merge conflicts, and no one likes dealing with those.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-shouldn-t-i-rebase-\">When shouldn&#39;t I rebase?</h2>\n<p>Once you&#39;ve pushed your code to your team&#39;s repo, don&#39;t rebase anymore.

Well, let&#39;s talk about what Arrays really are first. \n Here&#39;s the shocker: Arrays are objects. How, you might ask?\n Well first, lets take at what an object is - an object is a data structure that has key value pairs:</p>\n <iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/StudiousCostlyMontanoceratops?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Now let&#39;s take a look at something similar with Arrays.</p>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/KnowledgeableMellowSerpent?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<p>You&#39;ve probably had to access items at particular indexes before, and to do so you just pass in the index between <code>[]</code> brackets. The reality is, what you are doing\nis accessing the property <code>0</code>, in the same way we can access the property <code>steeringWheel</code>. With objects, the properties have to be strings, in fact if you try to do something like this:\n<code>myCar.10 = &#39;Cool&#39;</code>, you&#39;ll get an error: <code>Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected number</code>. Does that mean you can&#39;t have numbers as object properties? It does not! It just means you can&#39;t use the <code>.</code> \noperator to do so. <code>myCar[10] = &#39;Cool&#39;</code> is legitimate working javascript, <code>console.log(myCar[10]) \\\\ &#39;Cool&#39;</code>.</p>\n<p>So now you might be saying &quot;oh that&#39;s nice... but what does this have to do with anything?&quot; - I&#39;m getting to that! So now we know that under the hood, there are a lot of similarities between\nArrays and Objects. If you think about it, Arrays have other similarities! You can access methods on arrays with the period operator, like <code>.map()</code>, <code>.filter()</code>, etc. We also can&#39;t forget about the \never important array property, <code>.length</code> - this will come up in a second.</p>\n<p>Okay so you might be wondering, if you create an object, like this - is it an array?:</p>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/TinyLimegreenComet?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Hmm... we&#39;re getting close, but Arrays really need to know how long they are, all the cool looping you can do with arrays depend on them\ninternally being able to understand how long to loop for, ie, how long they are. Okay - we can fix that:</p>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/BelatedEvergreenAmericancurl?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Awesome! It&#39;s an array now, right?</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>... Almost. So javascript is clever, and it often tries to be too clever, but in this case it still just assumes you have an object, if you try to call <code>.map()</code> on\nthis object, it&#39;ll complain about map not being a function on this object. Okay, so how do we tell Javascript &#39;hey, this thing is basically an array, lets treat it like one&#39;.\n<strong>Finally</strong> this is where Array.from() comes in! Array.from() expects what is referred to as an <code>array-like</code> object. That&#39;s exactly what it sounds like,\nsomething that looks almost like an array, but isn&#39;t quite one. Well great, we have one of those!</p>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/ForcefulOvalFlatfish?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<p>We did it! Something to emphasise here is that length is the -most- important property here. Without length, this would happen:</p>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/SlowSplendidErin?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<p>You&#39;d get an empty Array. The mechanisms in Array.from() use the length of the array like object to inform it of the length of the array,\nwithout it, you get what you have above. Now you might be asking, what kind of cool things can I do with all this newfound knowledge?!</p>\n<h3 id=\"make-a-new-array-of-x-length-easy\">Make a new array of x length easy</h3>\n<p>Sometimes we need to make Arrays of a predefined length, lets say for example I want to make a function that will return me an array \nof numbers up until a number passed in - if I give this function <code>5</code>, I should get back <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>. Normally a for loop would do the trick, but what about\nsomething taking a bit less code?</p>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/UnsungBadCats?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\nThe above returns an array of numbers up to the passed in number. But how? Well we can see that in the <code>Array.from()</code>, the first\nparameter passed in is an object with a length property set to the passed in number - so if we passed in 5, it would be <code>{length: 5}</code>.\n\nOkay, so that means it&#39;s going to try and make an array of 5 items - if that was it by itself, what would happen?:\n\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/CooperativeTintedDunnart?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<p>What&#39;s with those <code>undefined</code>&#39;s? Well... I guess we didn&#39;t actually tell Array from what should be in each of those indexes. If we did, it would figure it out,\nfor example:</p>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/InsecureQuickStagbeetle?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\nYou can see that with a little help, <code>Array.from()</code> knows what to do, but if we don&#39;t give it any values, undefined actually makes the most sense. \nConveniently though, <code>Array.from()</code> takes <strong>two</strong> arguments. The second, optional argument is a map callback function. Meaning - this function gets called for each item\nin the new array, it has access to the value and the index like a regular map function does, and whatever it returns replaces the value at that index in the new array.\n\nOne more time:\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/FlimsyCreepyBaldeagle?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\nWhat I&#39;m returning above here is the index I am currently at (which starts at 0), plus 1. So that will give me a list of 1 to <code>listLength</code>. Useful!\n\n### Array.from() and strings\n\nSo now this has us thinking, what ELSE has length? And does it play nice with Array.from()? Let&#39;s take a look at strings, actually. We know that strings and arrays have a lot in common:\n\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/CanineDefiniteAsianlion?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<p>This seems like all we need to turn strings into Arrays!</p>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/InterestingZanyAfricanporcupine?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<p>And it is. There are other ways to turn strings into Arrays, and there aren&#39;t any real benefits in doing it this way as opposed to, lets say <code>&#39;Hello&#39;.split(&#39;&#39;)</code>. That being said, it&#39;s a good thing to\nremember that strings are &#39;array-like&#39;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"array-from-and-arguments\">Array.from() and arguments</h3>\n<p>As a quick recap, there is another interesting object we know about that has always seemed like it SHOULD be an array, but it isn&#39;t.\nThat&#39;s <code>arguments</code>. Now what was that again?</p>\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/GaseousDeadArizonaalligatorlizard?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\nIf you didn&#39;t remember, arguments is a special  <strong>array-like</strong> object available inside of any function, that resolves into key-value\npairs of the position in the parameter placement as a zero-indexed key, and the value being... well the value. So for the example above,\nfor <code>arguments[0]</code> the value is <code>4</code> because the first parameter being passed in resides in the &#39;zero&#39; position. Arguments also conveniently provides\nyou the length property. Arguments is <strong>so close</strong> to being an array, but it isn&#39;t. It even looks kind of like an array when you console log it. So turning it into an array is really\neasy with <code>Array.from()</code>:\n\n<iframe height=\"650\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    src=\"https://repl.it/repls/CommonEnragedDeer?lite=true\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    frameborder=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency=\"true\"\n    allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms\n    allow-pointer-lock\n    allow-popups\n    allow-same-origin\n    allow-scripts\n    allow-modals\"></iframe>\n\n<p>So cool! Now arguments doesn&#39;t feel so awkward.</p>\n"}]},"siteProps":{"title":"React Static"}};</script><script async="" src="/app.783d0b3d.js"></script></body></html>
